      description: |
        Call this endpoint to start syncing the wallet after the wallet file was created. \
        This is the second endpoint you need to call after creating the wallet file with /wallet/initialize. \
        Afterwards you can call the accept payments & check api health endpoints. Or shut things down orderly with the shutdown tasks. \
        \
        The monerochan merchant API will supply incoming payments as a JSON object to the url you provided in the callback variable. \
        Please make sure to attach a long random generated string to the callback, so that your application stays secure and users cant guess where the callback is located.

        Supply the path of the wallet where you want to receive the money. \
        As the payment_id you can use the autoincremented_id of a payment_request SQL table for example. \
        Make sure this payment_id is unique per product and client so that you know which payment is for which product or service and which client it came from. \
        You can also use this endpoint to query just the exchange rate or just get an address. \
        It is all combined in this endpoint because these RPC calls are expensive and you will most likely need all of these things at once. The default currency is USD. Check out other supported currencies here: <a href="https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/supported_vs_currencies">https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/supported_vs_currencies</a>
